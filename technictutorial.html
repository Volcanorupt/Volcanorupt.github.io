		<div class="sampleDescription">
		<p> The basic rule of alignment for studless and studded pieces: Holes in two bricks separated by two plates are exactly 3 studs apart. This trick shows how bricks with plates can be repeated
			at regular intervals to align with beams. For example, in
			order to have a 5-stud-long space between their pin holes,
			two bricks need to be spaced apart by seven plates, by a
			brick and four plates, or by two bricks and one plate, as
			one brick is three plates tall.</p>

		<h2 class="sampletitle">Keeping the gears in place</h2>
		<div class="sampleDescription">
		<p>Reinforcing perpendicular bevel gears is a more difficult
		   task, as even a minimal displacement in structure disengages
		   the gears. This is because their teeth come into contact over
           a small area. We need to make sure the gears are firmly
		   kept in place. A number of LEGO studfull and studless pieces
		   are designed specifically to reinforce perpendicular gears. When you have no dedicated LEGO pieces to reinforce
		   perpendicular gears, you can still use basic pieces to do so. </p><br><br><br><br><br>

		<h2 class="sampletitle">Differences between worms and regulars</h2>
		<div class="sampleDescription">
		<p>Unlike regular gears, a worm gear doesn’t push the follower gear to the side;
           instead, it pushes itself against the follower gear along its axle. Worm gears need particularly
           solid reinforcement. As the image beside the description shows, apart from
           pushing the follower gear away, worm gears have a strong
           tendency to slide along the axle they’re sitting on. This is
           a result of worm gears’ enlarged axle holes, which allow
           them to slide along axles. This lateral force can be strong
           enough to make a worm gear drill through adjacent pieces if
           sufficiently high torque is applied to it for a prolonged time!</p>

		<div class="sampleDescription">
		<p>The rubber band–based return-to-center steering attachment for a PF Medium motor. The mechanism consists of the band (white),
           which squeezes two beams (yellow) together to the sides of
           a connector sitting on the steering shaft (red). As the motor
           starts to rotate the shaft, the connector pushes the beams
		   apart. If the rubber band is strained enough, it will stop the
		   connector quickly, and when the motor stops, it will squeeze
		   the beams back together, returning the connector and the
		   shaft to the central position.</p><br>

		<h2 class="sampleTitle">Transferring power to steering axles</h2>
		<div class="sampleDescription">
		<p>A driven axle is a mechanism that connects two wheels while
			transferring drive to them from the chassis. The power is
			usually received from a driveshaft that is longitudinal to the
			chassis and perpendicular to the axle. Connecting these two
			elements is necessary, and a pair of bevel gears is the simplest
			solution. But in practice, bevel gears are prone to skipping
			under high torque, and a driven axle is where we can
			expect high torque. This leaves us with two other options: a
			differential or a pair of knobs. A differential is less likely to
			skip, especially if braced inside a proper structure.</p>

		<h2 class="sampleTitle">Chains and placement on gears</h2>
		<div class="sampleDescription">
		<p>A close-up view of the chain wrapped around a gear shows that
			each link occupies two teeth. The section of the chain that has contact with
			the gear has no play in it, and its elasticity is minimized. The chain link (left) is similar to the LE GO track link (right) and
			can be combined with it. The chain consists of small, rigid links that can be
			connected so that every link can be tilted relative to the next
			one. In this way, we can create a flexible
			but rigid chain of any length, which can be wrapped around
			gears.</p><br><br>

		<h2 class="sampleTitle">Linear and perpendicular gear directions</h2>
		<div class="sampleDescription">
		<p> An even number of meshed gears (left) and an odd number of
			meshed gears (right). When gears are meshed directly, the driver gear affects the
			follower gear’s direction of rotation. Whether the follower
			rotates in the same or in the opposite direction as the driver
			depends on the number of gears between them. When gears
			are in a parallel series, the rule is simple: With an even number
			of gears (2, 4, 6, and so on), the follower rotates in the
			opposite direction, and with an odd number of gears (3, 5,
			7, and so on), the follower rotates in the same direction.
			Direct observation may be the quickest means of
			determining the output rotation of gears that mesh perpendicularly.
			For example, in a 4×4 vehicle’s drivetrain with
			a longitudinal driveshaft, the front and real differentials
			must be oriented in opposite directions for the front and
			rear wheels to rotate in the same direction.</p>
