		<h3>Toggle Remote</h3>
		<p>This simple, robust modification on the toggle remote is suitable for
		   driving and steering. These are the required parts and steps needed to
		   build the remote. As the gear which functions as a dial rotates downward,
		   the vehicle should turn left. When the dial rotates upward, the vehicle
		   should turn right.</p>
		   <br><br><br><br>
		<h3>Speed Dial Remote</h3>
		<p>Modifications can also be made on the speed dial remote to control tracked vehicles,
		   with each speed dial controlling a single track. Two speed
           dials are connected by a central steering wheel, which can
           be rotated as well as tilted forward and backward. With
           properly switched pole reversers, the steering wheel tilt
           controls drive, and the steering wheel rotation controls
           steering. To make the vehicle drive forward and then turn
           right, for instance, you would tilt the steering wheel forward
           and then rotate it right.
           Note that this modification is subject to the disadvantages
           of the speed control remote—that is, it is limited to
           sending no more than two commands per second. It works
           best when operated carefully and not too fast.</p>

		<p>A sequential yet nonsynchronized transmission designed specifically to handle high torque,

			part of the transmission together with the motor attached
			to it. This makes the transmission simpler and reduces the
			number of gears.</p><br><br>

		<p>Two PF Medium motors are driving the differential case (blue) and one of the axles
		   (green). The other axle (red) is the output. 
			When a differential is used to couple motors, any
			difference between inputs will be equalized by the system of
			the differential’s inner gears. The output will be driven by the
			sum of the inputs’ torques and the average of their speeds. </p>

		<h2 class="sampleTitle">Flashing lights</h2>
		<div class="sampleDescription">
		<p>To make LEGO LEDs flash, we need a switch and a
		    motor. Using an old 9V switch is the easy way, but we can
			use a Power Functions switch as well, which we can connect
			via an eccentric mechanism. Figures 8-27 and 8-28 show
			both versions.
			With the old 9V switch, adding the ability to flash is
			simple: The switch can be connected directly to a motor
			whose rotary motion will keep turning it on and off, thus
			making the lights connected to the switch flash. The flashing
			frequency can be adjusted by adding a gear between the motor 
			and the switch or by changing the motor’s speed.</p><br>

		<h2 class="sampleTitle">Creating air pressure with motors</h2>
		<div class="sampleDescription">
		<p>A compressor that can hold two or four pumps while making
			use of two 36-tooth gears. The orientation of the gears relative to each
			other is maintained by two 12-tooth gears on a separate axle, which also
			transfers drive between them. It’s possible to connect two or more such
			compressors side by side to increase the number of pumps.</p>
		<p>You might ask why we would want to use so many
			pumps in the first place. It’s because a single pump has a
			very small capacity and is, therefore, not very powerful,
			taking quite a while to fill just a single large pneumatic cylinder.</p>
		<br>
		<p>A rocking compressor. While it doesn’t extend pumps to their maximum, it 
			can hold up to 18 pumps in two alternating groups. It moves the pumps in 
			a reciprocating motion, rather than the rotary motion used in other compressors, 
			which results in a more compact build. Moreover, it has a gearing at the side 
			with four possible gear combinations.</p>
